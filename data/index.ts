  aboutAuthor: 'Hi! I am Rohan Reddy, an aspring robotist and a golfer. Currently studying at Iron Horse Middle School in San Ramon, CA.',
  authorInterest: 'I am keen on working in robotics as I love building. I am learning mathematics to build strong foundations as it is used everywhere. I am also learning basics of mechanical design and 3D printing to become good at robotics. Eventually I want to learn physics, programming, mechatronics, control systems, AI, and business. OMG that is lot of interdisciplinary learning for robotics, which is why i love it!',

  aboutMe: 'Hello! I\'m a middle schooler who spends most of his time outside school finishing books in the AOPS set. My current target is to finish AOPS Calculus by the end of 8th grade. Apparently that is when fun starts as you use Calculus in physics and modelling systems. When I\'m not solving problems, you can find me resting or playing golf with my dad.'
